 1 IEC 60870 -5 Communication  
 
1.1 Introduction  to IEC 60870 -5 standard  
 
The International Electrotech nical Commission (IEC) defines IEC  60870 standards for telecontrol 
(supervisory control and data acquisition) in electrical engineering and power system automation 
applications. Part 5 provides a communication profile for sending basic telecontrol messages 
between a central telecontrol sta tion and telecontrol outstations, which uses permanent directly 
connected data circuits between the central station and individual outstations.  
 
IEC 60870 -5 consists of the following parts, under the general title Telecontrol Equipment and  
Systems ʹ Part 5 : Transmission protocols:  
x IEC 60870 -5-1 Transmission Frame Formats  
o This describes the operation of the physical and data link layers. It provides a choice 
of four data link frame types FT1.1, FT1.2, FT2 and FT3 with fixed and variable 
length.  
x IEC 60870 -5-2 Link Transmission Procedures  
o It describes service primitives and transmission procedures: the unbalanced and 
balanced transmission. It also describes whether transmission can be initiated only 
by a master station, or by any station.  
x IEC 60870 -5-3 Genera l Structure of Application Data  
o It specifies the general structure of data at the application level, rules for forming 
application data units, etc.  
x IEC 60870 -5-4 Definition and Coding of Application Information Elements  
o It provides the definition of inform ation elements and defines a common set of 
information elements used in telecontrol applications. These include generic 
elements such as signed or unsigned integers, fixed or floating point numbers, bit -
strings, and time elements.  
x IEC 60870 -5-5 Basic Appl ication Functions  
o It describes the highest level functions of the transmission protocol that include 
station initialization, methods of acquiring data, clock synchronization, 
transmission of commands, totalizer counts, and file transfer.  
x IEC 60870 -5-6 Gui delines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870 -5 companion 
standards  
 
IEC also generated companion standards for basic telecontrol tasks, transmission of integrated 
totals, data exchange and network access:  
x IEC TS 60870 -5-7 Security extensions to IEC 60 870-5-101 and IEC 60870 -5-104 protocols 
(applying IEC 62351)

The IEC 60870 -5 protocol stack is based on  the reduced reference model called Enhanced 
Performance Architecture (EPA) that includes three layers of ISO OSI model: application layer (L7), 
link layer (L2), and physical layer (L1), see Table 1.  
 
 
Table 1: EPA stack  
x Physical layer  defines the hardwar e-dependent specifications of the IEC 60870 -5-101/IEC 
60870 -5-104 communication interfaces. It i ncludes definition of communication interfaces 
(V.24/V.28 FSK, V.24/V.28 Modem, X.24/X.27 Synchronous), network configurations 
(point -to-point, multiple point -to-point, multi -point star, multi -point -party line, multi -
point -ring).  
x Data link layer  specifies frame formats (FT1.2 with fixed or variable length), bit order of 
information (starting with the LSB and ending with the MSB), and transmission procedures 
(bala nced or unbalanced mode, primar y or secondary stations, SEND/NO REPLY, 
SEND/CONFIRM, REQUEST/RESPOND services, link initialization ), see Section 1.2.  
x Application layer  defines the information elements for structuring application data and the 
communication service functions. It defines overall message structure, ASDU structure 
(see Section 2.2), message addressing and routing, information elements, and set of 
ASDUs.  
 
1.2 Transmission  
 
IEC 60870 -5-101 provides a communication profile for sending basic teleco ntrol messages 
between a central telecontrol station  (master, controlled station)  and telecontrol outstations  
(slave, controlling station) , which uses permanent directly connected data circuits between the 
central stat ion and individual outstations , see Fi gure 1.

Figure 1: Network topology  
The IEC 104 specification combines the application layer of IEC 60870 -5-101 and the transport 
functions provided by a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet P rotocol).  
 
IEC 101 allows two alternative transmission procedures  [2]: 
x Unbalanced transmission  ʹ the controlling station controls the data traffic by polling the 
controlled outstations sequentially. It initiates all the message transfers while the 
control led outstations only respond to these messages. The following services are 
supported:  
o SEND/NO REPLY ʹ for global messages and for cyclic set -point commands  
o SEND/CONFIRM ʹ for control commands and set -point commands  
o REQUEST/RESPOND ʹ for polling data from t he controlled outstations  
x Balanced transmission  ʹ in this mode, each station can initiate message transfer. The 
stations can act simultaneously as controlling stations and controlled stations (they are 
called combined stations). The balanced transmission i s restricted to point -to-point and to 
multiple point -to-point configurations. Supported services are:  
o SEND/CONFIRM  
o SEND/NO REPLY ʹ this can be initiated only by a controlling station with a broadcast 
address in a multiple point -to-point configuration

1.3 Communic ation  
 
An important concept in understanding addressing under IEC 60870 -5 is the difference between 
control and monitor directions. It is an assumption that the overall system has a hierarchical 
structure involving centralized control. Under the protocol, every station is either a controlling 
station or a controlled station.  
 
IEC 101/104 communication is exchanged between the controlled and the controlling station.  
x Controlled station  is monitored or commanded by a master station (RTU)  
o It is also called ou tstation, remote station, RTU, 101 -Slave, or 104 -Server.  
x Controlling station  is a station where a control of outstations is performed (SCADA)  
o Typically, it is a PC with SCADA system, can be also a RTU32.  
 
IEC 101/104 defines several modes of direction:  
x Mon itor Direction  is a direction of transmission from controlled station (RTU) to the 
controlling station (PC).  
x Control Direction is a direction of transmission from controlling station, typical a SCADA 
system to the controlled station, typical an RTU.  
       ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
8 
 x Rever sed Direction is a direction when monitored station is sending commands and 
controlling station is sending data in monitor direction.  
 
1.4 Application data objects  
 
IEC 60870 -5 has information on a set of information objects that are suited to both genera l SCADA 
applications, and electrical system applications in particular. Each different type of data has a 
unique type identification number (see Section 2.2 and Appendix C.1). Only one type of data is 
included in any one Application Service Data Unit (ASDU ). The type is the first field in the ASDU. 
The information object types are grouped by direction (monitoring or control direction) and by 
the type of information (process info, system info, parameter, file transfer).  
x An example of process information in monitoring direction is a measured value, e.g., a bit 
or an analog. In control direction it can be a command to set a bit or a value.  
x An example of system information in monitoring direction is initiation flag, in the control 
direction it can be interrogat ion command, reset, etc.  
 
Thus, application data is carried within the ASDU within one or more information objects. 
Depending on the variable structure flag (SQ, see Section 2.2) there may be multiple information 
objects each containing a defined set of o ne or more information elements, or there may be just 
one information object containing a number of identical information elements. In either case, the 
information element is the fundamental component used to convey information under the 
protocol.  
 
1.5 Addressing  
 
IEC 101 defines addressing both at the link and at the application level. The link address (or d evice  
address ) and ASDU address (or common address) are provided for id entification of the end station:  
x The device address  is the identification numbe r of the device.  
o The link address field may be 1 or 2 octets for unbalanced, and 0, 1 or 2 octets for 
balanced communication. As balanced communication are point -to-point the link 
address is redundant, but may be included for security.  
o The value range de pends on the link address length that can be one byte, i.e., range 
1 ʹ 255, or two bytes, i.e. range 1 ʹ 65 535. Typical values are 1 for IEC 101 and 2 
for IEC 104.  
o The link address FF or FFFF is defined as a broadcast address, and may be used to 
address a ll stations at the link level.  
x Each device on the communication network has a Common Address of ASDU  (COA or ASDU 
address ). The common address of the ASDU combined with the information object address 
contained within the data itself combine to make the un ique address for each data 
element.  
o COA is typically the application address of the client  (logical station)  that must 
match the address defined in the client configuration. This is defined as the address 
of the controlling station in the control directio n.         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
9 
 o In the monitoring direction, however , the  common  address field contains the 
address of the station returning the data ( controlled station ). This is required so 
that the data can be uniquely identified and mapped to the right points in system 
data image s.  
o The maximum value depends on the ASDU address length that is one or two bytes 
similarly to  the device address. Typical values are 1 for IEC 101 and 2 for IEC 104.  
The length of COA is fixed per system.  
2 IEC 104 Protocol   
 
IEC 60870 -5-104 Protocol  (aka IEC 104)  is a standard for telecontrol equipment and systems with 
coded bit serial data transmission in TCP/IP based networks for monitoring and controlling 
geographically widespread processes. Protocol standard defines the transferred data entities in 
the station object as equal to the ones used in the IEC 60870 -5-101 protocol. The implementation 
of the IEC 104 protocol uses the same as station objects (STA) as the IEC 101 implementation. IEC 
104 is designated according to a selection of transport functi ons given in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite 
(RFC 2000). Within TCP/IP various network types can be utilized including X.25, Frame Relay, ATM, 
ISDN, Ethernet and serial point -to-point (X.21), see Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 3: Protocol stack with IEC 104  
2.1 APCI forma t 
 
Each APCI  (Application Protocol Control Information)  starts with a start byte with value 0x68  
followed by the 8 -bit length of APDU  (Application Protocol Data Unit)  and four 8 -bit control fields  
(CF). APDU contains an APCI or an APCI with ASDU, see Figur e 4. Generally, the length of APCI is 6 
bytes.

There are packets with fixed length and with variable length containing Application Service Data 
Unit (ASDU , also called telegram ) [4].  
 
The frame fo rmat is determined by the two last bits of the first control field  (CF1) . The standard 
defines three frame formats, see Figure 5.

the controlled station . It has variable length.

o Control fields of I -formats indicates message direction. It contains two 15-bit 
sequence number s that are sequentially increased by one for each APDU and each 
direction.  
 The transmitter increased the Send Sequence Number N(S) and the receiver increases the 
Receive Sequence Number N(R). The receiver station acknowledges each APDU or a        ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ

 number of APDUs  when it returns the Receiver Sequence Number up to the number whose 
APDUs are properly received.  
 The sending station holds the APDU or APDUs in a buffer until it receives back its own Send 
Sequence Number as a Receive Sequence Number which is valid ackno wledge for all 
numbers less or equal to the received number.  
 In case of a longer data transmission in one direction only, an S format has to be sent in 
the other direction to acknowledge the APDUs before buffer overflow or time out.  
 The method should be used in both directions. After the establishment of a TCP 
connection, the send and receive sequence numbers are set to zero.   
 The standard case studies of sequence number acknowledgement is shown in Appendix A.  
 
o The right interpretation of sequence number s depends on the position of LSB 
(Least Significant Bit) and MSB (Most Significant Bit), see Figure 6.  Notice that the 
fixed bits (white background) on the most right position are not used for sequence 
numbers. Thus, sequence numbers of I -format have 15 bi ts only.

For example, sequence 0x06 0x00 0x02 0x00 (see above, right table) will be

o In any cases where the data transfer is only in a single direction, S -format APDUs 
have to be send in other direction before timeout, buffer overflow or when it has

x U-format (unnumbered  control functions ), last bits  of CF2  are 11  
o It is used to perform unnumbered control functions. It has fixed length.  
o U-format APDUs always consist of one APCI only. Only one of functions TESTFR  
(Test Frame ), STOPDT (Stop Data Transfer) or STARTDT (Start Data Transfer) can be 
activated at the same time. The binary values of CF1 are in Figure 7.

Figure 7: U -Frame functions and their codes  
o U-format is used for activation and confirmation mechanism of STARTDT, STOPDT 
and TESTFR.  
o STARTDT and STOPDT are used by the controlli ng station to control the data 
transfer from a controlled station.  
 When the connection is established, user data transfer is not automatically enabled, e.g., 
default state is STOPDT. In this state, the controlled station does not send any data via this 
connection, except unnumbered control functions and confirmations. The controlling 
station must activate the user data transfer by sending a STARTDT act  (activate). The 
controlled station responds with a STARTDT con  (confirm). If the STARTD is not confirmed,  
the connection is closed by the controlling station.  
 Only the controlling station sends the STARTDT. The expected mode of operation is that 
the STARTDT is sent only once after the initial establishment of the connection. The 
connection then operates with  both controlled and controlling station permitted to send 
any message at any time until the controlling station decides to close the connection with 
a STOPDT command.  
 Example of start and stop data transfer procedures is shown in Appendix B.  
 
o The control ling and/or controlled station must regularly check the status of all 
established connections to detect any communication problems as soon as 
possible. This is done by sending TESTFR frames.  
 Open connections may be periodically tested in both directions b y sending test APDUs 
(TESTFR=act) which are confirmed by the receiving station sending TESTFR=con.  
 Both stations may initiate the test procedure after a specific period of time in which no 
data transfer occur (time out).  
 
2.2 ASDU format  
 
The ASDU contain s two main sections: the data unit identifier  (with the fixed length of six bytes) , 
and the data itself, made up of one or more information objects. The data unit identifier defines 
the specific type of data, provides addressing to identify the specific id entity of the data, and 
includes additional information as cause of transmission. Each ASDU can transmit maximum 127 
objects. The format of ASDU is in  Fig. 8.

ASDU2 contains the following fields:

o 0 is not used, 1 -127 is used for standard IEC 101 definitions, 128 -135 is reserved 
for message  routing and 136 -255 for special use.  
o In the range of standard IEC 101 definitions, there are presently 58 specific types 
defined. These types form following groups, see Table 2.  
 
 
 
Table 2: Defined type code groups                                                        2 Fields and values of ASDU dissector in Wireshark are described in

14 
 o It is important to note that the type identification applies to the whole ASDU, 
therefore if there are multiple information objects contained in the ASDU, they are 
all of the same type.  
o The standard values of TypeID are listed in Appendix C.1. 
 
x SQ (Structure Qualifier)  bit specifies how information objects or elements are addressed.  
o SQ=0  (sequence of information objects) : addressing of individual single information 
elemen ts or combination of information elements in a number of information 
objects (IO) of the same type , see Figure 8 .  
 
 Each single element or a combination of elements is addressed by the information 
object address. The ASDU may consist of one or more than on e equal information 
object. The number of objects is binary coded (number of objects) and defines the 
number of the information objects.  
 
 SQ=0 implies a sequence of information objects  where each object has its own 
information object address. The number of  information objects is given by the 
seven -bit value in the date unit identifier (field number of objects, see Figure 7). 
Therefore there can be up to 127 information objects in this ASDU. [7]  
 
o SQ=1  (just one information object) : addressing of a sequence o f single information 
elements or equal combinations of information elements of a single object per 
ASDU , see Figure 9.  
 
 A sequence of equal information objects (e.g. measured values of identical format) 
is addressed by the information object address. The information object address 
specifies the associated address of the first information element of the sequence. 
The following information elements are identified by numbers continuously by + 1 
from this offset. The number of objects is binary coded (number o f elements) and 
defines the number of the information elements. In case of a sequence of 
information elements only one information object per ASDU is allocated.  
 
 When SQ=1, the structure contains a sequence information elements within one 
information objec t. All information objects are of the same format, such as a 
measured value. There is just one information object address, which is the address 
of the first information element.

x T (test) bit  defines ASDUs which were g enerated during test conditions and not intende d 
to control the process or change the system state.  
o T=0 (no test), T=1 (test)  
 
x P/N (positive/negative) bit  indicates the positive or negative confirmation of an activation 
requested by a primary applica tion function . 
o P/N = 0 (positive confirm), P/N = 1 ( negative confirm) . 
o P/N is meaningful when used with control commands. The bit is used when the 
control command is mirrored in the monitor direction, and it provides indication of 
whether the command was executed or not. When the PN bit is not relevant, it is 
set to zero.         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
16 
  
x Cause of transmission (COT)  
o COT field is used to control the routing of messages both on the communication 
network, and within a station, directing by ASDU to the correct program or task for 
processing.  ASDUs in control direction are con firmed application services and may 
be mirrored in monitor direction with different causes of transmission.  
o COT is a six -bit code which is used in interpreting the information at the destination 
station. Each defined ASDU type (see Appendix C.1, valid COT s) has a defined subset 
of the codes which are meaningful with it.  
o 0 is not defined, 1 -47 is used for standard definitions of this companion standard 
(compatible range), see Appendix C.2, 48 -63 is for special use (private range) . 
 
x Originator Address (ORG)   
o The originator address is optional on a system basis. It provides a means for a 
controlling station to explicitly identify itself. This is not necessary when there is 
only one controlling station in a system, but is required when there is more than 
one c ontrolling station, or some stations are dual -mode stations. In this case the 
originator address can be used to direct command confirmations back to the 
particular controlling station rather than to the whole system.  
o The originator address directs mirrore d ASDUs and interrogated ASDUs in monitor 
direction (e.g. interrogated by a general interrogation) to the source that activated 
the procedure.  
o If the originator address is not used (bits are set to zero) and there is more than 
one single source in a system  defined, the ASDUs in monitor direction have to be 
directed to all relevant sources of the system. In this case the specific affected 
source has to select its specific ASDUs .  
 
x ASDU Address Field  (Common Address of ASDU , COA ), see also Section 1.5  
o The add ress is called common address because it is associated with all objects 
contained within the  ASDU. This is normally interpreted as a station address, 
however it can be structured to form a station/sector address where individual 
stations are broken up into  multiple logical units.  
o COA is either one or two octets in length, fixed on a per -system basis.  
o The global address is a broadcast address directed to all stations of a specific system 
(broadcast address). ASDUs with a broadcast address in control direct ion have to 
be answered in monitor direction by the address that is the specific defined 
common address (station address). According to the standard this parameter 
consists of 2 octets.  
o Value 0 is not used, range 1 ʹ 65 534 means a station address, value 6 5 535 
(0xFFFF)  means global address.  
o Global address is used when the same application function must be initiated 
simultaneously. It is restricted to the following ASDUs:  
 Type=100 (Interrogation command): reply with particular system data 
snapshot at commo n time         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
17 
  Type=101 (counter interrogation command): freeze totals at common time  
 Type=103 (clock synchronization command): synchronize clocks to 
common time  
 Type=105 (reset process command): simultaneous reset  
 
2.2.1  Information Object s 
 
ASDU transmits information objects within its structure. Each information object is addressed by 
Information Object Address (IOA)  which identifies  the particular data within a defined station.  Its 
length is 3 bytes for IEC 104.  The address  is used as destination address in control d irection and as 
source address in monitor direction.  
 
x The third byte of IOA is only used in case of structuring the information object address in order to 
define unambiguous addresses within a specific system. In all cases the maximum number of 
different o bject addresses is limited to 65 535 (as for two bytes).  
x If the information object address is not relevant (not used) in some ASDUs, it is set to zero.  
 
All information objects transmitted by one ASDU must have  the same ASDU type (e.g., 5, step 
position i nformation, see Appendix C.1). If there are more objects of different types to be 
transmitted, they are inserted in several ASDUs.  
 
For each defined ASDU type, the IEC 104 standard defines the format of the information object, 
i.e., what informa tion elemen ts form such object and how they are structured.  
x Figure 10 shows an example of information object Single -point information without time (ASDU 
type=1). The object format has two forms: one for SQ=0 and one for SQ=1. Valid COT for this 
objects are : 2 (backg round scan), 3 (spontaneous), 5 (requested), 11, 12 (feedback), 20 +G 
(interro gated by station interrogation), see Appendix C.1.

 x Some in formation objects contain several information elements. For example, Figure 1 1 shows 
information object of type 10 (measured value, normalized with time tag). This object is defined 
only for SQ=0 and contains three information elements: normalized value NV A (2 bytes), quality 
descriptor (1 byte), and binary timestamp (3 bytes). For this type of object, valid causes of 
transmission are spontaneous (code 3) or requested (code 5, see Appendix C.2).

The number of information objects and information elements within the ASDU is the Number of

2.2.2  Information Elements  
 
Informati on elements are building blocks used to transmit information . Format and length of each 
information element differs and is given by the standard. The standard also describes how 
encoded values are interpreted.  
 
A list of available information elements is g iven in Appendix C.3. The list also gives the length of 
the element and object types where it is used.  
 
x The interpretation of values transmitted by an information element is also given by the standard 
and can be found in [7]. Figure 1 1 shows a format of t hree information elements: SIQ (single point 
of information), VTI (value with transient state indication) and SVA (scaled value). SIQ contains a 
set quality bits (see interpretation in Appendix C.4), VTI contains  a seven -bit value from the range 
<-64..+63> . SVA contains a 16-bit value in the range < -32 768..32 767> which represents a fixed 
decimal point number. However, the position of the decimal point is not transmitted by the value 
but it is set in the system database. For example, a value of 39.5 amps m ay be transmitted as 395 
where the resolution is fixed at 0.1 amp.         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ

 Figure 11: Example of three information elements: SIQ, VTI and SVA  
For SQ=1, the number of information elements within the information object is given in th e 
Number of objects field of the ASDU header. The structure of the information object contains:  
x Information object address  (3 bytes)  
x A set of information elements of the same type  
o The number of the elements is given in the ASDU header.  
o The format of the e lement is given by the standard and depends on the ASDU type.  
o The length of information object  can be computed using APDU length, e.g., 
information object_ length  (bytes) = APDU _length  ʹ ADPU _control_ fields  (4 bytes) 
ʹ ASDU_ header  (6 bytes) ʹ IOA (3 bytes)  = APDU_ length  ʹ 13 bytes.  
o The length of each information element within this object is given by object_length  
/ number_of_objects . 
x Please, remind that each of the elements belongs to one information objects which IOA is 
given by offset from the IOA in the  ASDU, e.g., +1 for the second element, +2 for the third 
element, etc.  
 
For SQ=0, the number of information objects is given in the Number of objects  field of the ASDU 
header. The format of the object, e.g., from which elements the object is built, is fixe d by the 
standard. The structure of ASDU data part is following:  
x Information object address of object no.1 (3 bytes)  
x A set of information elements of object no. 1  
x Information object address of object no.2 (3 bytes)  
x A set of information elements of object n o. 2 
x ͙  
x Information object address of object no.N (3 bytes)  
x A set of information elements of object no. N  
o The number of the objects is given in the ASDU header.  
o All of the objects are of the same type and thus have the same length.         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ

 o The length of the infor mation object can be computed as follows: object_length 
(bytes) = ( APDU_length ʹ ADPU_control_fields  (4 bytes) ʹ ASDU_header (6 bytes)) 
/ number_of_objects ʹ IOA (3 bytes) = ( APDU_length ʹ 10 bytes) / 
number_of_objects  ʹ 3 bytes

 2.4 Basic application functions  
 
Following application functions are implemented in IEC 101 communication  [2]: 
x Data acquisition  ʹ collecting data cyclically, upon change, or up on request  
o In unbalanced transmission, the controlled outstation must always wait for a 
request from the controlling station.  
o When balanced transmission is used, the buffered data is transmitted by the 
controlled outstation to the controlling station with out a delay.  
x Even acquisition  
o Events occur spontaneously at the application level of the controlled outstation. 
The transmission in balanced or unbalanced mode is similar to the data acquisition.  
x Interrogation  ʹ used for updated the controlling station af ter an internal initialization  
o The controlling station requests the controlled outstations to transmit the actual 
values of all their process variables.  
x Clock synchronization  
o After system initialization, the clocks are initially synchronized by the contro lling 
station. After, the clocks are periodically resynchronized by transmission of a clock 
synchronization command.  
x Command transmission  ʹ used to change the state of operational equipment.  
o A command may be initiated by an operator or by automatic super visory 
procedures in the controlling station.  
o Two standard procedures for command transmission:  
 Direct command  ʹ used by the controlling station to immediately control 
operations in the controlled outstations. Permission and validity of the 
command is che cked by the outstation  
 Select and execute command  ʹ a two -step command that prepares a 
specified control operation in a control outstation, checks that the correct 
control operation is prepared, and execute the command. The preparation 
is checked by an op erator or by an application procedure. The controlled 
outstation does not start the control operation until it has received the 
correct execute indication.  
x Transmission of integrated totals  
o Transmits values that are integrated over a specific time period using two 
methods:  
 Freeze -and-Read : acquisition of integrated totals  
 Clear -and-Read : acquisition of incremental information  
x Changes in protocol and link parameters  ʹ when the link parameters are changed  
x Acquisition of transmission delay  ʹ needed for time c orrection

 2.5 Transactional view on IEC 104 communication  
 
For security monitoring, it is better to group individual IEC 104 packets into transaction s. 
Considering  master -slave transactions  we can  divide  the communication  on transactions as 
depicted in the following table : 
 Master (10.20.102.1) < --- > Slave (10.20.100.108) communication No. Direction object Cause of transmission (COT) Setting values of the information element 
1 ----> IOA=0 activation interrogation command <---- IOA=0 activation confirmation interrogation command <---- IOA=0 interrogation command   IOA=1-4 interrogation command SIQ=0, DIQ=0 <---- IOA=1-4 interrogation command step position = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command bitstring = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command normalized value = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command scaled value = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command short float = 0  IOA=11-14 interrogation command SIQ=0, DIQ=0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command step position = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command bitstring = 0 with time tag <---- IOA=11-14 interrogation command normalized value = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command scaled value = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command short float = 0  with time tag IOA=0 activation termination interrogation command IOA=0 activation confirmation interrogation command IOA=1-4 interrogation command SIQ=0, DIQ=0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command step position = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command bitstring = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command normalized value = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command scaled value = 0 IOA=1-4 interrogation command short float = 0  <---- IOA=11-14 interrogation command SIQ=0, DIQ=0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command step position = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command bitstring = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command normalized value = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command scaled value = 0 with time tag IOA=11-14 interrogation command short float = 0  with time tag IOA=0 activation termination interrogation command 2 ----> IOA=13 activation single command ON <---- IOA=13 activation confirmation single command ON IOA=13 activation termination single command ON        ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ

The table shows logical transactions exchanged between the master and slave. Arrow represents 
direction: master to slave ( --->) or slave to master (< ---). A transaction usually concerns one 
information object with its address (IOA). Only exception is tran saction no. 1 which summarizes 
initialization of the system. Following transactions are initiated by the master station that sends 
activation command (COT=6) which is responded by the slave station using a sequence of 
messages with COT=7 (activation confir mation), COT=10 (activation termination) and COT=3 
(spontaneous).  
 
In the table, we can noticed some specific features of IEC 104 communication:  
x Destination is addressed on L7 by common ASDU address (COA) which is 10 in this case 
(address of the slave sta tion). Then, each destination contains several objects addressed 
by the information object address (IOA). Usually, the controlling station sends or retrieves 
data from the specific information object identified by its IOA.  
x Special destination address 0 doe s not refer to a specific information object but to the 
configuration of the whole slave system. Thus, initialization of the slave is addressed using 
IOA=0.  
x The transaction 1 sends an activation message with the interrogation command which 
enforces a sequ ence of interrogation answers from object 1 -4 and 11 -14 transmitting the 
actual settings of their values.  
x We can notice that one object with a given IOA can contain several types of information 
elements. E.g., object 1 has elements of type SIQ, DIG, step p osition, bitstring, normalized 
value, scaled value, or short floating point.         ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
25 
 x Some responses can be divided into several TCP packets, e.g., the response on transaction 
no. 4 is sent in two packets: one contains ActCon ASDU, the other ActTerm ASDU and Spon 
ASDU. This is different to transaction no. 3, where the response is sent via one TCP packet 
that contains three ASDUs: ActCon, ActTerm and Spon.  
x Some objects (e.g., 11 -14) returns values with timestamp, others (1 -4) do not use them.  
x One TCP packet can tran smit a sequence of ASDUs of several objects. E.g, the third 
response from slave in the transaction 1 transmits ASDUs with objects IOA=1 -4 and 
IOA=11 -14.  
x We can also see that some ASDUs contain one information element and some a sequence 
of information ele ments. This number is specified in the Number of Objects field in the 
ASDU header.  
 
2.6 Observation of IEC 104 communication  
 
After detailed analysis of the several PCAP sample of IEC 104 communication, we can make the 
following observations:  
 
1) One TCP stre am transmits several types of IEC format frames: U -frames, S -frames, I -frames. 
These frames have different format and usage for IEC communication. From point of view of 
network monitoring, it can be useful to keep statistics that include no. of packets, by tes, etc. 
for each of the frame formats.  
2) It is better to monitor transactions related to objects than individual packets. Each 
informational object is addressed by an IP address of the controlled station (on L3), by a 
controlled station address on L7 (comm on ASDU address, COA), and an object address (IOA). 
Thus, the transaction can be identified using a target address (COA+IOA) and action (COT, 
cause of transmission). Each transaction gets values or sets values of information elements 
that are part of the r eferred object. The standard defines which object type contains what kind 
of information elements.  
3) Transactions are build by exchanges of ASDU messages between the slave and the controlling 
station. There is no transaction ID, thus slave and master have t o check transactions based on 
COA, COT and OUI. If a message is lost, the loss is detected by L7 via ASDU sequence numbers 
and re -sent.  
4) One ASDU can transmits several objects, however, these objects must have the same COT.  
5) One TCP packet can contain seve ral ASDUs with same or different COTs.

 3 IEC 104 Security Monitoring  
 
This part discusses how flow monitoring approached can be applied on IEC 104 communication.  
 
3.1 Security issues of IEC 104  
 
When analyzing IEC 104, we can notice several similaritie s with SNMP monitoring . SNMP manager 
sends short commands to SNMP agent in order to set variables or retrieve their values. The same 
is IEC 104 master station. Unlike SNMP, IEC 104 does not define any security as access password s 
(via community string in S NMPv1 and SNMPv2 ), authentication (using RSA)  or encryption ( using 
SHA) as supported by  SNMPv3.  
 
This forms a serious vulnerability  against IEC 104 communication, especially when transmitted 
over unsecure IP layer. Possible attacks on IEC 104 communicatio n may include:  
x changing the value of an ASDU transmitted in the IEC 104 packet,  
x inserting spoofed ASDU messages into the network,  
x providing DDoS attacks on IEC 104 master or slave stations,  
x inserting a rogue control station into the network,  
x interception o f the transmitted data,  
x etc. 
  
These vulnerabilities and possible attacks are also discussed in [8] and [9]. We can mitigate 
possibility of these threats by hardening the access to IEC 104 communication  which is sometimes 
not feasible , or we can provide security monitoring with  anomaly detection . This can be 
implemented using Netflow monitoring.  
 
3.2 Recommended monitoring approach  
 
In case of flow monitoring, IEC communication is composed of one IP flow transmitting values and 
action related to a range of  different objects. Such a large set of useful data can be hardly 
incorporated in IP flow records. One solution is to look at IEC communication via transactions 
described above rather than classical IP flows. This can be implemented by creating several vir tual 
flows out of one IP flow with IEC 104 PDUs.  
 
Then, the monitoring can be similar to other request -response communication, for example DNS.  
DNS communication sends requests over UDP. A DNS client queries the DNS server which sends a 
response in one p acket.  
 
IEC 104 has similar behavior: IEC 104 transactions are directed to an information object at the 
controlled station using ASDUs. IEC 104 communicates in control mode (master to slave) or 
monitoring mode (slave to master). Each transaction has its t ype (C OT, cause of transmission); this 
can be parallel to the type of DNS request (A, PTR, etc.). A requested object identified by IOA can 
be compared with  the requested DNS query (like www.fit.vutbr.cz ).        ΞϮϬϭϳ͕ƌŶŽhŶŝǀĞƌƐŝƚǇŽĨdĞĐŚŶŽůŽŐǇ  
27 
  
As flow an alysis of DNS combines DNS requests and responses based on the transaction ID, IEC 
104 monitoring can combine IEC 104 transaction s identified by a sequence of COA , COT and IOA. 
For each transaction, we can monitor metadata ( e.g., no. of transmitted ASDUs, packets, bytes), 
or direct values of information elements transmitted in ASDUs.  
 
The implementation will be part of the further phase of the IRONSTONE project.

 Appendix C. 4: Quality bits  
 
IV = VALID (0) / INVALID (1)  
x A value is valid if it was correctly acquired. After the acquisition function re cognizes 
abnormal conditions of the information source (missing or non -operating updating 
devices) the value is then marked invalid. The value of the information object is not defined 
under this condition.  
x The mark invalid is used to indicate to the desti nation that the value may be incorrect due 
to a fault or other abnormal condition, and cannot be used.  
NT = TOPICAL (0) / NOT TOPICAL (1)  
x A value is topical if the most recent update was successful. It is not topical if it was not 
updated successfully dur ing a specified time interval or if it is unavailable.   
SB = NOT SUBSTITUTED (0) / SUBSTITUTED (1)  
x The value of the information object is provided by the input of an operator (dispatcher) or 
by an automatic source.  
x It means that the value is not derived  from the normal measurement.  
BL = NOT BLOCKED (0) / BLOCKED (1)  
x The value of information object is blocked for transmission; the value remains in the state 
that was acquired before it was blocked. Blocking prevents updating of the value of the 
point.  
x Blocking and deblocking may be initiated for example by a local lock or a local automatic 
cause.  
SPI = OFF (0) / ON (1)  
x Single Point Information   
x The value reported in the SPI of the Information Object is derived from the current state 
of the binary point. SPI=1 means status ON, SPI=0 means status OFF.  
OV = NO OVERFLOW (0) / OVERFLOW (1)  
x The value of the information object is beyond a predefined range of value (mainly 
applicable to analog values).  
x It is used primarily with analog or counter values.  
DPI = Dou ble Point Information  
x indeterminate or intermediate state (0) / determined state OFF (1) / determined state (ON) 
/ indeterminate state (3)  
EI = Elapsed time invalid (EI)  
x This is used with events of protection equipment. If set it means that the elapsed tim e 
interval value is invalid. This means that for some reason the elapsed time value cannot be 
relied upon and should be ignored.
